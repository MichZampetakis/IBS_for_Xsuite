# TODO Steps

- [x] Cleanup the `lib` folder.
- [ ] Add a LICENSE file, to be figured with Michalis as he is the code rights owner at the moment.
- [ ] Clean up the Python code.
- [ ] Separate actual code and running + plotting scripts.
- [ ] Go over the Python modules and make a package (new repo). In time this should all be a `pip`-installable package implementing the same functionality.
- [ ] Speed up the code!

Remember to keep benchmarking at each step.
