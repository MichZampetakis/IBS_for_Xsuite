# TODO Steps

- [X] Cleanup the `lib` folder.
- [X] Add a LICENSE file, to be figured with Michalis as he is the code rights owner at the moment.
- [X] Clean up the Python code.
- [ ] Go over implementation details with Michalis on his code to comb through and add documentation.
- [X] Separate actual code and running + plotting scripts.
- [X] Go over the Python modules and make a package (new repo). In time this should all be a `pip`-installable package implementing the same functionality.
- [ ] Discuss package structure with Elias.
- [ ] Write tests -> benchmark on damping times vs MAD-X (see Elias gitlab), old code results etc.
- [X] Have a full API documentation of the new package online.
- [ ] Write user guide -> how to use in `xsuite` simulations, options, caveats, etc.
- [ ] Speed up the code!
