# XIBS

This repository contains what became `xibs`, a prototype for Intra-Beam Scattering modeling and computing to be later integrated into [xsuite](https://github.com/xsuite).

This started as a fork of M. Zampetakis' work on a simple but physics-accurate [IBS implementation](https://github.com/MichZampetakis/IBS_for_Xsuite).

See the [documentation](https://fsoubelet.github.io/xibs/) for details (yet to be written, as is the package).

## Installing

Installation is easily done via `pip`:
```bash
python -m pip install xibs
```
