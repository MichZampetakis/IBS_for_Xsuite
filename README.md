# IBS_for_Xsuite

This is my fork of M. Zampetakis' work on IBS, meant as a starting point to improve and include into `xsuite`.
As inherited from Michalis, `Xsuite_IBS.py `is the main script to run which performs tracking with the IBS implementation on the CLIC Damping Ring.
In `lib/IBSfunctions.py` are the implementations for both of the kicks + Nagaitsev analytical calculation.
