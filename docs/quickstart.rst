Quickstart
==========

This is currently under construction and will be developed along with the API.

.. hint::

   You can click the function names in the code examples below to go directly to their documentation.

Basic Usage
-----------

The package is imported as ``xibs``.
Several modules give access to different functionalities calculating relevant IBS properties through different formalism.

.. code-block:: python

   import xibs

   # Start with examples
   pass

Go over here the basic philosophy of the package: no matter the formalism used the API will work similarly.
In time, a unified interface (e.g. `xibs.ibs(..., formalism="...")`)?

Formalism and Models
--------------------

Here will be an overview of the different formalism and models available in the package.

.. autolink-preface:: import xibs
.. code-block:: python

   # Start with examples importing each
   pass



Using with xsuite
-----------------

An overview of how to integrate this into ``xsuite``.
While this package is used it is a prototype and integration will not be seamless.
